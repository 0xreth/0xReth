## $ whoami --verbose
Day job: I pull apart networks, apps and infra from the inside out—delivering full‑scope security audits, purple‑team drills and no‑nonsense pentest reports that make “exploit chain” a theoretical term for my clients.

Off the clock: I speak fluent market microstructure. I build scrapers that inhale ticks, back‑testers that torture alpha signals, and automation that fires option legs while the kettle boils. Money shouldn’t sleep, and neither do my bots.

Beyond the perimeter, I connect open-source dots, pivot through metadata trails, and illuminate knowledge graphs to extract actionable insights. The open web is my recon playground, where signal always.

## $ ./risk2reward -mdqc
When monitors cool off, Bloomberg-terminal brain takes over.  
- **Macro**: yield-curve spelunking, FOMC tape-reading  
- **Derivatives**: delta-neutral spreads, vol-surface spelunking, gamma-scalping (*yes, I speak fluent options-Greek*).
- **Quant**: backtesting factor models in pandas, hunting for that elusive *α* without blowing the **β** gasket  
- **Crypto/DeFi**: liquidity-pool archaeology, on-chain forensics, staking where the gas fees don’t bite  

*TL;DR*: I chase convexity, not lottery tickets.

## $ ./projects --status active
A multi-account options trading engine that turns data into executable trades:

- **Stack**: Python 3.11 • Redis • PostgreSQL • Docker • Interactive Brokers API
- **Data Processing**: Information monitoring with AI-powered data classification and structured signal extraction
- **Market Integration**: Real-time options data feeds with multi-broker execution capabilities
- **Risk Management**: Position-based controls with Kelly-fraction sizing and account isolation
- **Operations**: Containerized deployment with health monitoring and automated failover

The system transforms unstructured intelligence into disciplined, risk-managed positions across multiple accounts faster than you can say "QQQ 568C 7 Aug". 

If alpha exists in the noise, this bot finds it, validates it, and trades it.
